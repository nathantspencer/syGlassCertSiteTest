		<h2>What are syGlass certificates?</h2>
		<p>
			syGlass certificates are issued to individuals who, using <a href="https://syglass.io"
			target="_blank">syGlass software</a>, reach specific training milestones or contribute
			to certain participatory science collaborations. Certificates are marked according
			to the achievement(s) for which they were issued.
		</p>

		<h2>How can I verify a certificate?</h2>
		<p>
			Each individual to whom a certificate has been issued is assigned a certificate ID
			that begins with "SY" and ends in a string of numbers. Certificates can be verified
			by entering the certificate ID in the text entry field beneath the header "Verify
			a certificate" below and pressing "Verify."
		</p>

		<h2>Verify a certificate:</h2>
		<form id="verifyForm">
			<label for="idField">Enter the certificate ID below and press "Verify."</label>
			<br/><br/>
			<input type="text" id="idField"></input>
